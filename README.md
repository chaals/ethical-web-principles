This repository contains the [Editor's Draft](https://w3ctag.github.io/ethical-web-principles/) of the [W3C TAG Ethical Web Principles](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/) TAG Finding. Here's the abstract:

> The web should be a platform that helps people and provides a net positive social benefit. As we continue to evolve the web platform, we must therefore consider the ethical consequences of our work. The following document sets out ethical principles that will drive the TAG's continuing work in this direction.

You can help make this document better! Feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/w3ctag/ethical-web-principles/issues/new) with your thoughts or suggestions.
